🚀  ML -Driven System for Coronary Heart Disease Detection and Recommendation
 
Domain:-
Healthcare, Predictive Analytics,Explainable AI

Objective:
To design and develop a machine learning-based solution for early detection of Coronary Heart Disease using patient clinical data and provide personalized preventive recommendations to reduce future risk

Our Model Journey :

⚫Data Collection:

Data collection is from UCI Heart Disease Dataset

⚫Data Preprocessing:
    Handling missing data
    Encode the Categorical Values
    Normalize the continuous Variables
    Class imbalance handling (SMOTE/under sampling)


⚫ Model Development
   ▪️Train and compare various models:
     •Logical Regression
     • Random Forest
     •  XG Boost
     • SVM
     • Voting Ensemble
   ▪️ Evaluate using accuracy,F1,Recall,ROC-AUC


⚫ Explainability Layer(Optional):
    ▪️Using SHAP/LIME to explain model predictions and highlight the risk-features


⚫ Recommendation System:
 ▪️ Based on the risk factors and thresholds provide personalized advice (diet, smoking cessation, checkups)


⚫Visualization Dashboard :
  ▪️A simple web-based interface showing:
      • Input parameters
      • Risk level
      • Feature Coordinates
 
 ⚫ Expected output:
       •  Trained ML model with 85% accuracy
       •  Personalized risk prediction dashboard
       •  Explainable insights using SHAP plots
       •  Rule based system generating health recommendations

⚫ Tech Stack:
    • Platform : Colab notebook
    • Languages : Python
    • Libraries: scikit learn, pandas,numpy,matplolib/seaborn,XGBoost ,SHAP, Flask/Streamlit(for dashboard)
    • Tools :Git ,Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code
